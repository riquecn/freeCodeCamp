              Historians know very little about the life of this historical figure.
            </li>
            <li>
              It is believed that she was born in Brazil and grew up in Palmares from childhood.

              She was married to Zumbi dos Palmares, with whom she had three children.

            <li>
              She was a capoeira practitioner; she contributed to the Palmaristas’ food production and frequently participated in hunting. She was also an important warrior, even leading troops in the fight against the Portuguese. Politically, she is believed to have been a significant figure.
            </li>
            <li>
              Dandara’s death was tied to the destruction of the Quilombo dos Palmares. During Zumbi’s leadership, Portuguese attacks became frequent, and in the battles that took place, Dandara demonstrated her skill with weapons and her ability as a military strategist. Supposedly, she was captured by the Portuguese, and to avoid being enslaved, she committed suicide on February 6, 1694.
